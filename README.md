# Open Lap [![CI build status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/tkem/openlap/CI)](https://github.com/tkem/openlap/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Open Lap is a simple, no-nonsense slot car race management app for
Carrera® DIGITAL 124/132 systems.

In a nutshell, Open Lap lets you

- connect your mobile device via Bluetooth using Carrera AppConnect®,
  or a suitable serial to USB On-The-Go adapter cable.
- take it easy during free practice, go for fastest lap in qualifying,
  or compete in lap or time based race sessions.
- get informed about important events, such as fastest laps or low
  fuel conditions, by personalized voice messages.
- adjust vehicle speed, brake force and fuel tank size for each car
  individually.
- measure up to three intermediate or sector times (S1, S2, S3) using
  Carrera® Check Lane or compatible equipment.
- send out the pace car in case of emergency, or temporarily disable
  lap counting during a "yellow flag" phase.

Some features, such as the start light and pace car buttons, will
require Carrera® Control Unit firmware version 3.31 or higher.
Carrera® Check Lane support requires at least firmware version 3.36.

The Android version is available on [Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.co.kemmer.openlap).
You may also want to join the [Beta testing
program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/at.co.kemmer.openlap) to
preview unreleased versions.

An iOS version, maintained by [Philipp
Anné](https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/id965549566), is available
on the [App
Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/open-lap/id1448048406).

Open Lap is also available as a [Progressive Web
App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications),
hosted at
[https://tkem.github.io/openlap/](https://tkem.github.io/openlap/).
To use this with Carrera AppConnect®, you'll need a Bluetooth 4.0
adapter and a recent version of
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome).  On Linux, at least,
you'll also have to go to

```
chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features
```

and enable the highlighted flag.
